Investigation Title	"HMS LINCS Breast Cancer Cue Signal Response"
Investigation Description	"This investigation consists of two HMS LINCS Breast Cancer Cue Signal Response datasets: -Breast Cancer CSR Dataset 1 (Niepel) 43 cell lines were treated with 16 growth factor/cytokine ligands at 2 doses each (1 and 100 ng/ml). Phosphorylation of 4 targets (pErk, pAkt, pP38, pJNK) was monitored at 3 time points (10, 30, 90 min) by imaging. This dataset is represented in the plates named GF1, GF2, GF3, and GF4. -Breast Cancer CSR Dataset 2 (Niepel) 43 cell lines were treated with 7 growth factor/cytokine ligands at 2 doses each (1 and 100 ng/ml). Phosphorylation of 4 targets (pErk, pSTAT1, pSTAT3, nuclear NF-kB) was monitored at 3 time points (10, 30, 90 min) by imaging. This dataset is represented the plates named CK1 and CK2."
